Hi!

<img alt="Mikhail Shilkov" src="/about/me.jpg" style="float:right; width: 220px" />

I'm Mikhail Shilkov, a software professional, and the host of this blog. 

Here are some software topics which I'm passionate about:

- Reactive programming
- Functional programming (mainly F#)
- Clean architecture (and best parts of DDD)
- Elastic systems in cloud environments
- Stream processing, complex event processing
- Data intensive applications
- Event-driven systems and event sourcing
- Effective learning
- Poker and poker bots
- Behaviorism and its relation to technology

I am now learning some bits and pieces of Scala, Spark and Akka.

I live in Eindhoven area, the Netherlands; and I originate from St. Petersburg, Russia.
If you happen to be close by, and interested in the same range of topics, let's have a chat!

Currently, I work at [Astrata Europe](http://astrata.eu) as a Senior engineer.
