Hi!

<img alt="Mikhail Shilkov" src="/about/me.jpg" style="float:right; width: 220px" />

I'm Mikhail Shilkov, a software professional, and the host of this blog. 

I am a Microsoft Azure MVP, which means I know some Azure and I'm trying to help other people to learn it. 

I'm passionate about serverless and other cloud technologies, functional programming and the intersection of the two.

I live in Eindhoven area, the Netherlands, and I originate from St. Petersburg, Russia.
If you happen to be close by, and interested in the same range of topics, let's have a chat!

You can also hire me for part-time contracts in the Netherlands, Belgium or remotely.

You can contact me at:
