In this post I'd like to share my exprerience about the first hackathon that I took part in. It was called "The Green Hackfest" and took place in Utrecht, Netherlands on 10-12 October 2014.

A brief introduction on what hackathon is. A hackathon, or a hackfest in this case, is an event for programmers, engineers, designers and entrepreneurs where they can get together, form teams and work on solving problems in creative way. The time is very limited, usually from 12 to 24 hours, but in this case we had a 'marathon' of 48 hours. At the start, teams get the challenge(s) definition and in the end they must pitch their ideas, prototypes and mockups to the judges to win the prizes. The participants are traditionally called hackers, which does not mean that they hack bank networks and that stuff, but rather that they strive to overcoming the usual limitation in whatever area they are competing.

So we gathered together on Friday evening, and stayed in the hackspace until Sunday night. Participants are provided with all the intrastructure during this time: power plugs, wifi, tables & chairs, food, drinks and sleeping room.

The whole story starts with introduction and then with briefs from sponsors. This way we got the tasks for these 2 days. There were several tasks, so everyone could choose which one suits them the best. Some folks were late, so they were having troubles afterwards to get the idea of what's expected from them.

I think there were about 70 participants in beginning, and about 50 of them made it to the end. Most people came alone or in pair; and I think there were two pre-formed teams of several people. 

I am the software developer and I was expecting that most of hackers will also be developers, mostly on experienced side. But I was quite wrong. Many people were from entrepreneural background, coming from ventures on early stage, or research environments. Many folks were students with no career set yet. In result, I was the only person who was able to write code in our team, and one of the most experienced programmers overall.

So the first task for everyone was to build a team for yourself. There was no formal procedure for that. You just meet people, ask what they think about the challenges and try to start the discussion, then go to someone else, and repeat. Sooner or later, you should find someone with whom you are ready to spend the next 45 hours working on a project. The normal team is of 2 to 5 people, and you should ideally join diverse skills. So if you are a developer, search for entrepreneurs or other idea generators, and also someone with design skills.

This time we had the following briefs, all of them were more or less related to green tech:

- ?

- Optimize manufacturing line based on monitoring data to use less energy without compromising the production schedule

- Make people in Utrecht use more bicycles instead of cars (tough task, as Utrecht is one of the cities were pretty much everyone is already using bicycles)

- ?
