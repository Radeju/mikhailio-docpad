*This is the third part of **Building a Poker Bot** series where I describe my experience developing bot software 
to play in online poker rooms. I'm building the bot with .NET framework and F# language which makes the task relatively 
easy and very enjoyable. Here are the previous parts:

- [Building a Poker Bot: Card Recognition](http://mikhail.io/2016/02/building-a-poker-bot-card-recognition/)
- [Building a Poker Bot: String and Number Recognition](http://mikhail.io/2016/02/building-a-poker-bot-string-recognition/)
